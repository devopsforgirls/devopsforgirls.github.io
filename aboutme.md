Hey there! My name is Gloria and thanks for stopping by! 

I'm an experienced devops engineer, having been doing devops since 2015 and been working in tech for even longer. I live in the general Silicon Valley area and am passionate about automation, privacy and getting stuff done.

At the recent Grace Hopper Celebration/Conference, I noticed a significant lack of young women devops/systems engineers. I came home and looked around on the interwebz and noticed how few female voices there are in this awesome career path. 
So I decided to do something about it, and here we are. :)

On my site you'll find a few things, although you probably came here from the YouTube channel.

- Resources: These are books I recommend you read, as they are all ones I found helpful in my devops/systems engineering journey. 

- Course: I'm putting together a training course on what women need to know to go into the devops/cloud infrastructure/systems engineering career. I still have a day job doing devops (Yep, practicing what I'm preaching!), so it's not up yet, but when it is, you can sign up here.

- Coaching: Have a question about devops that isn't answered on my channel? Just want to talk to someone about which career direction you want to go? Here is where you can schedule me for a career coaching session. I don't have a background in software engineering, so can't help much there, but if you are considering a more devops-y type career path, let's talk! I can probably help.
